Description: I cite and look up the code from Beej's Guide. Because some of the function does not support in C langauage, I use the C++ language to program this assignment.
I also cite and look up the code from: https://www.cnblogs.com/leezheng/p/8030011.html
All of the functions and server works well. To seperate the database and calcserver, I initialize two sockets to transfer. The output corresponds to the .pdf demo.
I am so sorry that I handle this assignment late because I had three midterms, 2 interviews and 1 GRE Exam, so that I just started my PA2 today moring. Please forgive me!
